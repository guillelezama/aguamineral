# Aguamineral Project

## Overview
The Aguamineral Project is an analytical study focused on government purchases of mineral water during a reported water crisis in Uruguay. Amidst government denials of a crisis, this project aims to reveal trends in mineral water purchases by the government, offering insights into the actual situation.

## Project Objective
To investigate whether the Uruguayan government increased its procurement of mineral water concurrent with the alleged tap water crisis.

## Key Findings
The analysis reveals a significant increase in the government's mineral water purchases, suggesting a contradiction in the government's public stance on the water crisis.
